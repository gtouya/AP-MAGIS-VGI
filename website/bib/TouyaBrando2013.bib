@article{abstract = {Whereas defining the level of detail ({LoD}) of authoritative data sets is possible, the opposite is true for volunteered geographic information ({VGI}), which is often characterized by heterogeneous {LoDs}. This heterogeneity is a curb for map-making, particularly when using traditional map derivation processes such as generalization. This paper proposes a method to infer the {LoD} of {VGI} features. Then, inconsistencies between features with different {LoDs} that get in the way of good map-making can be automatically identified. Some proposals are made to harmonize {LoD} heterogeneities. The inferring of {LoDs} is implemented, and results are presented on {OpenStreetMap} data.},

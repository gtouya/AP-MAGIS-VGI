@inproceedings{abstract = {This article presents a general framework to formalize the gen-eralization of land-use coverages within the ScaleMaster2.0 model, a multi-scale automatic generalization system, developed to facilitate smooth transitions (i.e. cartographic continuum) between level of details in a multi-representation database (MRDB). The article describes the land-use simplification method developed, the strategy used to manage generalization on large areas, and the way to formalize multi-scales land-use generalization rules in the ScaleMatsre2.0. Finally, an experiment is provided on two datasets to illustrate the proposition: a land-use coverage in the area of Dakar (Senegal) and a map of sedimentary floor off the coast of Brittany (France).},

    abstract = {Little by little, co-existing geographical data sets are integrated into multi-representation databases, where the data sets represent different level of detail, or different point of views for the same geographical features. The {ScaleMaster} model makes it possible to formalize how to choose the features to map from the different data sets. The paper proposes an extension of the {ScaleMaster} model that drives automatic generalization rather than guidelines for manual mapmaking. The {ScaleMaster} 2.0 has been implemented and is tested for use with real data.},
